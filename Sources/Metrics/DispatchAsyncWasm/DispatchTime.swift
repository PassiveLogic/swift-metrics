/// # About DispatchAsync
///
/// DispatchAsync is a temporary experimental repository aimed at implementing missing Dispatch support in the SwiftWasm toolchain.
/// Currently, [SwiftWasm doesn't include Dispatch](https://book.swiftwasm.org/getting-started/porting.html#swift-foundation-and-dispatch)
/// But, SwiftWasm does support Swift Concurrency. DispatchAsync implements a number of common Dispatch API's using Swift Concurrency
/// under the hood.
///
/// The code in this folder is copy-paste-adapted from [swift-dispatch-async](https://github.com/PassiveLogic/swift-dispatch-async)
///
/// Notes
/// - Copying here avoids adding a temporary new dependency on a repo that will eventually move into the Swift Wasm toolchain itself.
/// - This is a temporary measure to enable wasm compilation until swift-dispatch-async is adopted into the SwiftWasm toolchain.
/// - The code is completely elided except for wasm compilation targets.
/// - Only the minimum code needed for compilation is copied.

/// The very first time someone tries to reference a `uptimeNanoseconds` or a similar
/// function that references a beginning point, this variable will be initialized as a beginning
/// reference point. This guarantees that all calls to `uptimeNanoseconds` or similar
/// will be 0 or greater.
///
/// By design, it is not possible to related `ContinuousClock.Instant` to
/// `ProcessInfo.processInfo.systemUptime`, and even if one devised such
/// a mechanism, it would open the door for fingerprinting. It's best to let the concept
/// of uptime be relative to previous uptime calls.
